Flexible Solutions often makes emergency repairs in the field. We evaluate and handle each expansion joint failure independently. The following details a unique online emergency repair situation:

  <ul>
    <li>A large hole developed in a fabric expansion joint by the abrasive flow stream between the boiler and the precipitator of a coal-fired power plant. This duct operates under negative pressure created by the ID fans.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Once our crew was on site, the plug was carefully lifted into place, maintaining the plugâ€™s orientation to the to the hole in the fabric belt.</li>
    <li>Scaffolding was erected on site while the plug was designed and constructed off site.</li>
    <li>The negative pressure immediately sucked the plug into place and the built-in flange prevented excessive pressure from being exerted on the torn fabric belt. This entire procedure took only a few hours on site and allowed the unit to operate safely and efficiently until the next scheduled shutdown.</li>
  </ul>
